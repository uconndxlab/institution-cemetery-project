# Institution Cemetery Project

Welcome to Institution Cemeteries, an Interactive Web Map that plots unmarked graves of people with disabilities and mental illnesses in cemeteries in mental institutions. This project is a companion piece to _The Fate of Human Beings_ film

**This project needs to prioritize accessibility**

This project seeks to memorialize the people who were forgotten in these graves and to inspire research and cemetery rehab efforts
